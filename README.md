# LLO8200_spring2021
Materials for LLO8200 - Spring 2021 Semester

Hello Data Science!

In this GitHub Repository you will find all the files you need for this term of Data Science (LLO8200). We'll talk more about this in class, but this will get you started. Over the course of the term, I may update assignments/code/etc... so please alert me if you're going to be working ahead. If you work ahead and then things change, you will be responsible for updating your work. 

Orientation to folders:
  Async_Rmdfiles - .Rmd files for the weekly async lectures are here. Note, some of the code has changed since the async videos were recorded. The .Rmd files in this folder are updated in those cases (and also have additional annotations from me). I will add these as we go. 
  Async_datafiles - data files for weekly async lectures

I ask that you come to this class with an open mind. If you are open to it, you WILL learn how to code in R, you WILL learn how to run valuable statistical analyses, and you WILL leave this class knowing things you didn't know before. If you come in without this openness, then you will experience frustration and likely not learn nearly as much as you could. We have the next 14 weeks together - let's make the most of it!

Looking forward to meeting you all soon (and seeing some of you again).

-Lacey
