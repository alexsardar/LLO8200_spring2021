## Welcome to Data Science (LLO8200), Spring 2021

This is a supplementary page for Professor Hartigan's section of LLO 8200 Introduction to Data Science. Make sure you bookmark and check this page frequently for the most up-to-date files to use for both async and assignments. Over the course of the term code may be optimized or corrected, so please alert me if youâ€™re going to be working ahead. (_If you do work ahead, you will be responsible for updating your work if the assignments are updated._) You should have R, RStudio, and Tidyverse installed prior to the first day of class. Instructions for installing can be found [here](./Download_or_UpdateR).

### Async Lecture RStudio (.Rmd) Files
These are the RStudio files and datasets that you will use in tandem with the async videos each week.
1. Week 1 - [Introduction](./Async_Rmdfiles/01_Intro.Rmd), [College datafile](./Async_datafiles/college.Rdata)
2. Week 2 - Conditional Means (new video link coming, please do not use the one in the LMS)

### Async Lecture Slides

### Assignments
Each assignment (problem set) is worth 100 points. The problem sets are should be uploaded to the async before live session on their given due date. All assignment submissions should include two files:
1. Your .Rmd code file
2. Your "knit" assignment file. The knit file can be an html, word, or pdf document (please choose one and do not submit it in multiple formats). 

There may be a penalty for submissions not meeting these requirements.
