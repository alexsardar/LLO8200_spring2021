## Welcome to Data Science, Spring 2021

This is a supplementary page for Professor Hartigan's section of LLO 8200 Introduction to Data Science. Make sure you bookmark and check this page frequently for the most up-to-date files to use for both async and assignments. Over the course of the term code may be optimized or corrected, so please alert me if you’re going to be working ahead. (_If you do work ahead, you will be responsible for updating your work if the assignments are updated._) You should have R, RStudio, and Tidyverse installed prior to the first day of class. Instructions for installing can be found [here](https://uvastatlab.github.io/phdplus/installR.html).

### Async Lecture RStudio (.Rmd) Files
These are the RStudio files and datasets that you will use in tandem with the async videos each week.
1. Week 1 - [Introduction](./scripts/01-intro.Rmd), [College datafile](./scripts/college.Rdata)
2. Week 2 - [Conditional Means](./scripts/02-condition_means.Rmd)

Each assignment (problem set) is worth 100 points. The problem sets are due on the Sunday prior to the following week’s live session. All assignment submissions must be in “knitted” format:  html, doc, or pdf. There may be a penalty for submissions not meeting this requirement.
